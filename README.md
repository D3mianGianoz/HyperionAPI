# HyperionAPI

Public API for Hyperion Instruments from Micron Optics, Inc.

This repo was created to help people to use original Micron Optics API - they didn't publish it on Github.

There are small changes into the original package to extend support till python3.11 and to make it easier to install.

Also small style changes to comply with PEP and to make it more readable.
